	title: "Penny Is A Chat-Based Personal Finance Coach",
	body: "Have you ever wondered why being financially responsible can be so difficult? Maybe it’s because most money management tools are too complicated and overwhelming for the average user. Penny, a new personal finance app, is fixing this by giving users personalized financial advice via a simple chat interface. As soon as you open the app for the first time, Penny starts talking to you, almost as if you were just texting your banker. Even the traditionally tedious process of linking your bank account to a new app is done by just chatting with Penny. After your account is tied to the app, you can talk to Penny and ask her to do thing like show how much you spent on food in October, or show you a graph of your income vs. spending over the past two months. Penny also will push out information to you, doing things like reminding users how much they spent this week on food, etc. One downside with Penny is that users can’t just type requests. Instead, the app gives you prewritten prompts to send, like “How’s October going,” or “My Account Activity”. However, the company explained that offering prewritten responses result in much less friction for users. Basically, some younger users may not know what questions to ask about their finances, and would just not use Penny if they had to ask their own questions. That being said, the company eventually hopes to incorporate natural language processing so users can craft their own prompts. However, even without custom messages, Penny already offers a hundred different potential conversations, with multiple options for progressing through each one. For a closer look at Penny, check out our TC App Review above, or download Penny from the iOS App Store and Google Play Store."

		title: "Penny raises $1.2M in seed funding for its personal finance bot",
		body: "Penny, a personal finance bot we reviewed last fall, has raised $1.2 million in seed funding from Social Capital.

			As a refresher, the app offers a chat-based interface that offers advice tailored to your personal finances. This advice includes things like how much you spend on food each week, how this month’s spending compares to last month’s and even income graphs.

			One unique thing about Penny is that the app only lets you send pre-populated messages, not natural language requests.

			While we originally touted this as one of Penny’s downsides, the recent explosion of chat-based bots (most of which are terrible at parsing a user’s natural language requests) now helps explain why pre-populated messages may actually be beneficial to the user. The startup explains that they implemented this feature so the user isn’t forced “to figure out not only what they want to ask, but also how to ask it in a way the bot understands.”

			Essentially, the pre-populated options make it easier for a user to just talk to the bot, and not worry about what to say and how to say it.

			Since we looked at Penny last year, the startup has also rolled out new features to help people change their financial behavior. For example, the app now will help users decide if their gym membership is worth it, or compare your Amazon spending with the average person’s.

			As we enter the age of bots, it’s becoming clear that a messaging interface just isn’t the best way to do everything. Shopping is an example — many startups have pushed shopping bots, but until the technology progresses, it’s definitely not easier or better than shopping through a traditional e-commerce site.

			On the other hand, finance could be an area where bots shine. No one likes to log into their bank’s account portal, and even when they do it’s difficult to parse and understand the itemized statements offered each month. A bot can interpret this information and simplify it for the user, which hopefully can lead to the average consumer being better at understanding their financial situation.

			Penny currently only lives in its own iOS- and Android-based mobile app. However, Mitchell Lee, co-founder of Penny, noted that they would definitely consider putting their bot on a platform like Facebook Messenger, but not yet — mainly because the startup can’t yet see a clear value proposition of offering Penny on other platforms. This is because the young platforms aren’t yet developed enough to fully support Penny’s key features (secure password entry, pre-populated responses, etc).

			The startup will use the funding to hire one or two people to deepen their expertise in machine learning, a critical (but often forgotten) part of developing a bot. It will also let them continue to experiment with figuring out how Penny will provide value to users, as the app currently doesn’t have any monetization components."

	title: "How to Play the Debate: A Personal-Finance Guide",
	body: "Listen closely tonight. It's your money and your life.
		At 9 p.m. ET, in the first presidential debate of the season, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump will be pressed, to a degree, for details of their various proposals. Jobs, wages, taxes, student debt, child care, Social Security ... any or all of these could come up. And many of the vows, threats, visions, and hallucinations flying around the studio will eventually settle in the dustbin of history.
		But some of these things will actually happen, in one form or another, so it's a good idea to watch the proceedings with an eye, and ear, to your personal finances. Where do the candidates stick to their stated policies, and where do they diverge, or contradict themselves on issues that could affect you financially? What are they saying, and signaling? And what can you do about it?
		Here, then, is your personal-finance cheat sheet for the debate. At the very least, you'll come away from the back-and-forth with a clearer sense of its potential impact on you, your working life, and your retirement.

	title: "Personal-Finance Tips for Millennials",
	body: "Millennials are more entrepreneurial and willing to change careers than other generations, but they're still falling behind when it comes to saving for a rainy day and retirement. According to GOBankingrates.com surveys, 67% of millennials don't have any money stashed away for emergencies in a savings account and 42% of millennials haven't set aside a dime for retirement. If you're a millennial who is falling short of your personal finance goals, here are some tips to get yourself on track. 

		No. 1: Choose cash over credit
		Credit card churning is a hot trend with millennials right now, but charging purchases to reap credit card rewards is risky business. According to risk-management services company Dun & Bradstreet, people spend 12% to 18% more when they use credit cards instead of cash, and since rewards cards encourage credit card spending, they may be exposing millennials to big financial risks down the road.

		For example, Chase's Sapphire Reserve card is one of the most popular credit cards among millennials right now because it offers best-in-class travel rewards. Demand has been so high for this card that the company ran out of the special metallic cards it was issuing and has had to issue traditional plastic cards instead. The Sapphire Reserve's travel rewards include a $300 annual travel reimbursement and a chance at 100,000 points worth $1,500 in travel, if booked through Chase's travel website.
